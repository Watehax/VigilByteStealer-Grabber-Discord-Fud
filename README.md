I have made numerous updates to the Discord API across various versions, guided by the links provided. One major challenge was linking accounts across platforms like YouTube, Steam, and GitHub, particularly when using the 'get' function. This was due to the complex transformation of data into dictionary formats, which was difficult because the API data was presented as arrays of dictionaries. This task proved to be quite challenging.

Additionally, I have integrated the user's account biography as a footer in the token acquisition interface. A significant breakthrough was accessing user banners in gif or png formats, which differs from the previous method of retrieving avatars. I updated the integration of linked accounts into the token acquisition framework, removing unnecessary characters for better clarity.

I urge that this program be used only for educational purposes. It is designed to help understand how credentials can be acquired and is aimed at assisting malware analysts and non-technical users. The goal is to facilitate learning, analysis, research, reverse engineering, and critical evaluation.

**Tool Description**

Google Chrome securely protects user data, making it a challenge for the Grabber to access. The tool operates by decrypting stored data, which can give the attacker access to passwords and code clusters.

The tool can detect Roblox cookies in the Windows Registry and can also extract data from Minecraft sessions, Discord tokens, and similar information stored on a user's device.

# **Recommended Tools for Investigation**

After generating output, use these tools for further analysis:

- VirtualBox
- VMware
- Process Hacker
- VirusTotal

# **Evaluating .exe Files**

To verify the legitimacy of .exe files, use these methods:

1. Examine the file with VirusTotal.
2. Check the file's source and publisher.
3. Test the file in a sandboxed environment.
4. Monitor the file's network behavior for any unusual patterns.
